This is a Shiny app that tries to predict the chances of survival in Titanic crash using a prediction model.

The dataset used in this work is available at: 

<https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data>.

For prediction, I made use of a random forests model.

This app is created as part of the Coursera course "Developing Data Products" (<https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-products/>).
